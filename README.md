# Email Spam Detection – Classification

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) using text classification. The model is built using Python and Scikit-learn, and trained on the popular SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
Dataset used: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) or [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## 📊 Results
The classifier achieves a high accuracy in detecting spam messages using simple yet effective techniques.
